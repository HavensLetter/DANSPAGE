    <h2>Restoring More Than Bones</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Daniel Ivankovich is more than an orthopedic surgeon — he’s a movement maker. Known nationally as “The Bone Healer,” he has dedicated his life to restoring mobility, dignity, and hope to thousands of patients in underserved communities. 
    </p>

    <h2>A Surgeon with Soul</h2>
    <p>
      With over two decades of experience specializing in spine, knee, and hip reconstruction, Dr. Ivankovich brings both clinical precision and deep compassion to every case. His philosophy is simple: every patient deserves expert care, regardless of income, background, or insurance status.

    <h2>Bridging Medicine and Mission</h2>
    <p>

His work has been featured by CNN Heroes, Oprah, NPR, and countless other outlets.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond the Operating Room</h2>
    <p>
      A former blues musician and community activist, Dr. Dan’s presence extends beyond the hospital. He’s as comfortable with a guitar as he is with a scalpel — bringing healing and rhythm to every space he enters.
    </p>

      <li>Recognized by CNN Heroes, Chicago Tribune, and Rolling Stone</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Patients Trust Dr. Dan</h2>
